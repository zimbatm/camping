== Camping, a Microframework

Camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 3kb of code.
You can probably view the complete source code on a single page. But, you
know, it's so small that, if you think about it, what can it really do?

The idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application in a single
file like many small CGIs. But to organize it as a Model-View-Controller
application like Rails does. You can then easily move it to Rails once you've
got it going.

== A Camping Skeleton

A skeletal Camping blog could look like this:

  require 'camping'
  
  Camping.goes :Blog

  module Blog::Models
    class Post < Base; belongs_to :user; end
    class Comment < Base; belongs_to :user; end
    class User < Base; end
  end

  module Blog::Controllers
    class Index
      def get
        @posts = Post.find :all
        render :index
      end
    end
  end

  module Blog::Views
    def layout
      html do
        head { title "My Blog" }
        body do
          h1 "My Blog"
          self << yield
        end
      end
    end

    def index
      for post in @posts
        h1 post.title
      end
    end
  end
  
== Installation

Interested yet?  Luckily it's quite easy to install Camping.  We'll be using
a tool called RubyGems, so if you don't have that installed yet, go grab it!
Once that's sorted out, open up a Terminal or Command Line and enter:

* <tt>gem install camping</tt>

Or for the bleeding edge:

* <tt>gem install camping --source http://gems.judofyr.net</tt>

Camping itself only depends on Rack[http://rack.rubyforge.org] and using the
command above will only install Camping and Rack.  However, if you intend to
use the views you also need to install +markaby+, and if you're going to use
the database you need +activerecord+ as well:

* <tt>gem install markaby</tt>
* <tt>gem install activerecord</tt>

* Start by reading the documentation in {the Camping module}[link:classes/Camping.html],
  it should get you started pretty quick.
* {The wiki}[http://wiki.github.com/camping/camping] is the place for all tiny,
  useful tricks that we've collected over the years.  Don't be afraid to

  the place where it's all happening!  Don't worry, though, the volume is just
  as micro as Camping itself.
